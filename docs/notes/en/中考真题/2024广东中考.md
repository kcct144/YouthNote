People know animals do have feelings, but they are not sure if these feelings are correctly understood. In recent years, scientists have done research about the feelings of cows, frogs and pandas. ▲ It says that humans can tell whether a chicken is happy or sad by listening to its calls.

The researchers put a bowl behind a door. Inside the bowl, sometimes, there was something chickens love to eat, such as rice or insects. Sometimes, there was nothing. When the chickens saw food behind the door, they seemed happy and produced fast and loud sounds, known as food calls. When there wasn’t food, the chickens made low and long noises to express disappointment. The researchers recorded all these sounds and studied their waves.

Then the researchers chose 16 recordings of such chicken noises. Half were from the chickens seeing the food and half were from the chickens finding no food. The recordings were played to 194 volunteers. Sixty-nine percent of the volunteers correctly understood whether the chickens were feeling happy or not, and some of them even had no experience of taking care of chickens.

The result shows that humans have the natural ability to understand the feelings of chickens. Hopefully, this finding can bring about new technology to help with chicken-raising, a big industry in many countries. Some scientists are already working on a smart computer program that can identify chickens’ feelings. This is good news for farmers who want to make the birds happier and healthier.

56. Which of the following can be put in “\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_” in Paragraph 1?

A. Humans may not like animals. B. Scientists know nothing about it.

C. Nobody knows why this happens. D. A new study adds chickens to the list.

57. Which is most probably the sound wave of a happy call by a chicken?

A. B. C. D.

58. How did the volunteers help with the research?

A. By listening to the chicken calls. B. By taking care of the chickens.

C. By finding food for the chickens. D. By making the chickens happy.

59. What does the underlined word “identify” mean in Paragraph 4?

A. Control. B. Hide. C. Recognize. D. Hurt.

60. What is the best title for the passage?

A. Chickens’ Food Calls B. Happy Chickens, Sad Chickens

C. Farmers’ Best Choice D. Smart Farmers, Healthy Farmers
