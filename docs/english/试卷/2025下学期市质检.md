## 阅读理解 B

Scientists have long known dolphins are among the smartest ocean animals. However, a recent study in the Gulf of Mexico shows their communication might be as hard as human language. Researchers discovered that wild dolphin families create special “signature whistles (标志性口哨)” to recognize each other, much like how people use names.

To test this, the team played underwater recordings of different dolphin whistles. When a dolphin heard its family’s special sound, it quickly swam toward the speaker. _________ This proved these sounds act like personal IDs. The study also found dolphins mix whistles in creative ways to share messages, such as warning about danger or pointing out food locations.

Interestingly, baby dolphins spend months practicing these sounds, just like human babies learning to talk. This suggests adult dolphins actively teach their young, an unusual behavior in the animal world. Scientists say this finding helps us understand how intelligence (智力) develops in different species.
Sea biologists believe studying dolphin language could aid conservation (保护) efforts. For example, knowing how dolphins communicate about dangers might help protect them from ocean pollution or ship noises. Already, some teams are using AI tools to ==decode== dolphin sounds in real time. In this way, humans could better watch dolphin health and create safer sea environments.

This research not only deepens our love for dolphins’ intelligence but also reminds us to protect these amazing animals and their underwater home.

26. What did dolphins do when hearing their family’s whistle?
  - A. They swam away quickly. 
  - B. They repeated the same sound.
  - C. They moved toward the sound. 
  - D. They warned others of danger.

27. Which of the following can be put in “_______” in Paragraph 2?
  - A. However, it copied unknown sounds like “Hello”.
  - B. However, it ate fish happily when hearing strange calls.
  - C. However, it paid no attention to whistles from unknown groups.
  - D. However, it swam faster when boats made loud engine sounds.

28. How do baby dolphins learn communication according to the text?
  - A. Through long-time practice. 
  - B. By copying their mothers.
  - C. With human help. 
  - D. Using AI technology.

29. What does the underlined word “decode” in Paragraph 4 most probably mean?
  - A. Recognize. 
  - B. Translate. 
  - C. Copy. 
  - D. Listen.

30. What is the best title for the passage?
  - A. Saving Dolphins in the Ocean. 
  - B. Baby Dolphins’ Learning Journey.
  - C. How AI Helps Marine Research. 
  - D. The Amazing Whistle Language.

## 回答问题

In recent years, programming robots has been a popular way to help students develop problem-solving skills. At Bright Future Middle School, students work in pairs as “coding buddies”(编码伙伴) to design and control robots. This method makes learning fun and teaches teamwork. The school started a coding buddy program in September 2024. Over 18 months, younger students learned basic coding logic with the help of older students, while older students improved their leadership skills.

One success story is Tom, a ninth grader. He said, “Teaching my buddy to fix a robot’s movement error helped me see coding in a new way.” Teachers noticed students became more patient and creative. Class discussions increased by 40%, and the school won a national robot contest in 2025.

The program also made the school community stronger. Buddies often met after class to practice, and some even made mini-robots for school events. “Seeing their robots light up the stage was magical,” said a teacher. Next year, the school plans to invite experts to give workshops and let all grades join the program.
